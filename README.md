# Stack
**StackImplementation.cpp** contain the Implementation of Stack Using Array in C++

Below mentioned are some Stack Applications:- 

- **InfixToPostfixAndPostfixEvaluator.cpp** converts an infix expression to postfix and also evaluate Postfix Expression.Header File use in this program is **StackHeaderFileForPostfix.hpp**

- **AdditonOfTwoNumber.cpp** Adds two highly big integer passed as a string.
Header File use in this program is **StackHeaderForAdditionOfTwoNumber.hpp**

- **ParenthesisValidator.cpp** check whether the brackets passed in the expression are in correct order or not (ignore any syntatical error beside brackets in expressison).
Header File use in this program is **StackHeaderForParenthesisValidator.hpp**

# Searching

- **LinearSearch.cpp** search the elements from the array using Linear Search Algorithm. Templates is used in the given program, hence we can search an element of any type from the array of that type.
- **BinarySearch.cpp** search the elements from the array using Binary Search Algorithm. Templates is used in this program as well.
